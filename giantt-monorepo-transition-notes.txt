The Giantt project is in a state of transition, where it was previously a fairly detailed CLI that involved local manipulations to files which were then shuttled back and forth with an online project in an AI chat application by file upload, but now I'm reimplimenting it as something designed to use soradyne, a project for using multiple devices all connected into a personal set which constitute your data storage and digital identity, as a synchronization backend, meaning that much of the functionality is getting ported to dart with rust bindings. I'm moving toward a system that can be modified on one device using a nice chat interface, which is then synchronized in a structurally/by-design consistent way to the others (CRDTs is the basic ideas, though whatever works is ok too) and all changes are automatically propagated to all other devices, all without necessarily having any leader or anything brokering a connection, done as peer-to-peer as possible, usually within the same room or so, so some of the data exchange is via things like bluetooth low-energy. soradyne is its own whole project, and giantt is a vision that existed before soradyne was conceived, but I realized soradyne would massively support giantt, hence the messy pivot. I want to be sure all the great work that went into the CLI ends up in the version that runs in the app supported by soradyne, so I've symlinked it at /giantt-original/ and I would like to note that it's there as documentation support, basically, and not supposed to be edited or (certainly) committed in any way, it's for reference. Still I think almost all of its source code should be examined, except the packages dir maybe, which now has a more recent version in the burgeoning giantt_core package in the soradyne monorepo.
